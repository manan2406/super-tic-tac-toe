# super-tic-tac-toe
Super Tic-Tac-Toe is an advanced version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, designed using Python's tkinter library. The game features a 3x3 grid of smaller Tic-Tac-Toe boards, where players must win both individual boards and the overall game. The interactive GUI allows players to engage in a more complex and strategic variation of Tic-Tac-Toe.
